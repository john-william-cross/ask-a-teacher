                           A prediction is an educated guess, based on
                           information you already have, about what you think
                           will happen in the future. An inference is a
                           conclusion you draw, based on information you already
                           have, about what is happening NOW.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                           Here’s some examples: The sky is quickly darkening,
                           with swirling clouds and strong winds. You see
                           lightning and hear thunder in the distance. Based on
                           that information, you can predict that it is going to
                           rain. Meanwhile, a family member is asleep inside
                           your house. It rains, and they sleep through the
                           entire storm. They wake up and look outside. There
                           are puddles everywhere and everything is wet. From
                           that information, they can infer that it rained.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                           Here are some more inferences and predictions: A
                           little kid’s bedroom has pink walls, pink carpet, a
                           pink bedspread, and pink picture frames on the walls.
                           From this information, you can infer that the kid
                           likes the color pink.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                           You wake up with a stuffed nose and a sore throat.
                           You sneeze all day. You might infer that you have a
                           cold. Your birthday party is tomorrow. You’ve been
                           asking for a bike. As you open up presents, the first
                           gift you open up is a bike helmet. You can predict
                           that one of your gifts will also be a bike.

                           Predictions are guesses about the future based on
                           current evidence. Inferences are conclusions drawn
                           about the current time. Think of a detective. A
                           detective looks at clues and makes an inference about
                           what might have happened at a crime scene. The
                           detective infers what happened at the crime scene,
                           meaning she used clues to guess what already
                           happened.
