                  A prediction is an educated guess, based on information you
                  already have, about what you think will happen in the future.
                  An inference is a conclusion you draw, based on information
                  you already have, about what is happening NOW.
                  <br /><br />Here’s some examples: The sky is quickly
                  darkening, with swirling clouds and strong winds. You see
                  lightning and hear thunder in the distance. Based on that
                  information, you can predict that it is going to rain.
                  Meanwhile, a family member is asleep inside your house. It
                  rains, and they sleep through the entire storm. They wake up
                  and look outside. There are puddles everywhere and everything
                  is wet. From that information, they can infer that it
                  rained.<br /><br />
                  Here are some more inferences and predictions: <br /><br />
                  A little kid’s bedroom has pink walls, pink carpet, a pink
                  bedspread, and pink picture frames on the walls. From this
                  information, you can infer that the kid likes the color pink.
                  You wake up with a stuffed nose and a sore throat. You sneeze
                  all day. You might infer that you have a cold. Your birthday
                  party is tomorrow. You’ve been asking for a bike. As you open
                  up presents, the first gift you open up is a bike helmet. You
                  can predict that one of your gifts will also be a bike.
