                     A prediction is an educated guess, based on information you
                     already have, about what you think will happen in the
                     future. An inference is a conclusion you draw, based on
                     information you already have, about what is happening NOW.
                  </p>

                  <p class="mb-4">
                     Here’s some examples: The sky is quickly darkening, with
                     swirling clouds and strong winds. You see lightning and
                     hear thunder in the distance. Based on that information,
                     you can predict that it is going to rain. Meanwhile, a
                     family member is asleep inside your house. It rains, and
                     they sleep through the entire storm. They wake up and look
                     outside. There are puddles everywhere and everything is
                     wet. From that information, they can infer that it rained.
                  </p>

                  <p class="mb-4">
                     Here are some more inferences and predictions: A little
                     kid’s bedroom has pink walls, pink carpet, a pink
                     bedspread, and pink picture frames on the walls. From this
                     information, you can infer that the kid likes the color
                     pink.
                  </p>

                  <p class="mb-4">
                     You wake up with a stuffed nose and a sore throat. You
                     sneeze all day. You might infer that you have a cold. Your
                     birthday party is tomorrow. You’ve been asking for a bike.
                     As you open up presents, the first gift you open up is a
                     bike helmet. You can predict that one of your gifts will
                     also be a bike.
